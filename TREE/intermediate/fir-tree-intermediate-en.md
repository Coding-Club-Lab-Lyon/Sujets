It will be important to separate your functions logically in order to complete this program.

It will be required that your score contains the following functions:

<code>def trunk(size):</code>
This function should be used to calculate and display the trunk of the tree.

<code>def leaves():</code>
This function allows the calculation and display of all the leaves!
